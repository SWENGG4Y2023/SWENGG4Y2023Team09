### Purpose

The purpose of testing is to ensure that the OYO Booking System meets the specified requirements, functions as intended,
and provides a satisfactory user experience.

### Scope

This test plan covers the functional and non-functional testing of the OYO Booking System, including its core features
and key system components.

### Test Items

The test items for the OYO Booking System include:

- User registration and login
- Hotel search and booking
- Payment processing
- Room availability and pricing
- Booking confirmation and cancellation
- User management and administration

### Features to be Tested

The following features of the OYO Booking System will be tested:
User registration and login, Hotel search and filtering, Room availability and pricing, Booking creation and management,
Payment processing, Booking confirmation and cancellation, User profile management, Administrative functions (hotel
management, reporting, etc.)

### Test Approach

The test approach for the OYO Booking System includes the following:
Conducting functional testing to verify that the system meets the specified requirements and functions correctly.
Performing usability testing to ensure the system is user-friendly and provides a seamless booking experience.
Conducting regression testing to verify that system updates or changes do not introduce new defects or impact existing
functionality.

### Responsibilities

The following roles and responsibilities are assigned for the testing process:

- Test Manager: Overall test planning and coordination
- Test Analyst: Test case design and execution
- Development Team: Assist in defect analysis and resolution
- Business Analyst: Provide requirements clarification and validation

### Test Strategy

The test strategy covers the functional and non-functional testing aspects of the OYO Booking System, including user
registration and login, hotel search and booking, payment processing, room availability and pricing, booking
confirmation and cancellation, user management, and administrative functions.

### Test Levels:

1. Component Testing: Individual components of the OYO Booking System will be tested in isolation to ensure their
   functionality and correctness.
2. Integration Testing: The integration between different components will be tested to verify the seamless interaction
   and data flow.
3. System Testing: The entire OYO Booking System will be tested as a whole to validate its end-to-end functionality,
   performance, and usability.

### Test Types:

1. Functional Testing: Verifying that the OYO Booking System meets the specified functional requirements and performs as
   expected.
2. Usability Testing: Evaluating the user interface, user experience, and ease of use of the booking system.
3. Performance Testing: Assessing the system's performance, responsiveness, and scalability under normal and peak loads.
4. Security Testing: Identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities, such as data breaches or
   unauthorized access.
5. Compatibility Testing: Ensuring that the OYO Booking System works correctly on different platforms, browsers, and
   devices.
6. Regression Testing: Repeating select tests to ensure that new changes or updates do not introduce new defects or
   impact existing functionality.
7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conducting tests with real end-users to validate that the system meets their
   requirements and expectations.

### Test Techniques

1. Equivalence Partitioning: Grouping test inputs into classes and selecting representative test cases from each class.
2. Boundary Value Analysis: Testing input values at the boundaries of valid and invalid ranges.
3. Decision Table Testing: Using decision tables to capture combinations of inputs and corresponding actions or
   outcomes.
4. Error Guessing: Applying experience and intuition to identify potential defects or weak areas in the system.
5. Exploratory Testing: Concurrent test design, execution, and learning based on real-time exploration of the system.
